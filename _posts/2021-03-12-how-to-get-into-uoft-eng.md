Hey there!

I was recently admitted into both Engineering Science and St. George Computer Science programs at the University of Toronto.

Reflecting on my university application experience, I'm going to walk you through the admissions process at U of T.
I'm also going to provide insight based on my own experience and opinions: on writing the application, engineering interview, and more.

This article will focus on **Engineering.** For my computer science post, stay tuned.

I'll also be updating this post whenever I find new important information.

# Applying on OUAC

Like any other Ontario university, you'll have to first apply to both these programs on the OUAC website, before proceeding to the supplementary application process.

It's important to note here: Unlike other universities, **U of T programs CARE about how you rank them**.

Hence it's always best to rank your U of T programs in the top 3. If you don't, your application might be penalized.

# Supplementary Application

The engineering faculty handles the supplementary application on a separate portal.
The Engineering Applicant Portal is your primary resource for completing, and tracking the status of your application to the
Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering. The Engineering Portal is also where you will complete the mandatory Online Student Profile.

There are two sections that are VERY important:

1. Extracurricular Activities
2. Personal Profile

While there are other sections, I won't be focusing on them as they're pretty trivial/factual: program choice, school information, and explanations of special circumstances.

## Extracurricular Activities

Your EC's are filled in a table format, where you're asked for its name, description, position, scope/level, dates, hours, and reference contact.
I **highly recommend** you make a separate table on Google Docs/Word, and begin filling these in as early as you can. It will help tremendously and editing
your information directly in the portal is generally not a good idea.

**Note: There is no real word limit to the activity description.**
But, I do suggest keeping these descriptions short and succinct. In fact, I actually kept my descriptions in bullet points.

Here's a general guide to how I wrote about my EC's:

* One bullet to describe the activity if it’s not clear from the “Name”

* One bullet to explain my primary role and my duties/responsibilities

* One bullet to show my “trackable progress” within the activity

* One bullet to highlight my most noteworthy accomplishments or contributions

* One bullet to cover any key exposure(s) the activity gave me

* One bullet to sum up the major takeaways, new skills, and lessons I gained

Of course, not all these points applied to every activity - some activity descriptions were one-liners (e.g. Math Contests).

Here's a quick example:

    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">

Description:
- As Secretary of the school delegation, I structured club logistics over the summer using platforms like Discord, Zoom, and MUNCommand to ensure a smooth virtual experience in the new year.
- Introduced and developed a club website to keep track of information and club communications.
- Ran mock committee sessions during weekly meetings to familiarize Model UN team with conference procedure.
- Competed in international conferences, including the GEOMUN 2020 where we won ‘Best Small Delegation’ amongst representatives from the Americas.
- Whilst gaining insight on world issues like social media based election interference, I also developed public speaking and teamwork skills working with delegates from around the world.

I highly suggest having these descriptions edited by someone you trust - a friend, parent, or an older sibling who might already be in/graduated from university.
Remember, these admissions officers are going through thousands of applications! Be as concise as possible.


### How many activities should I put?

For engineering, there isn't a cap on number of activities. Personally, I don't think putting more will be a detriment to your application.
However, **please don't put more activities in for the sake of raising your activity number.** Add them if they're meaningful achievements/activities.

In my case, I put 16 entries: 6 clubs, 4 community involvements, 6 awards.


### COVID section?

For the 2020-2021 application cycle (my year), we were given a 250-word section to answer the following prompt:

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many planned events and activities were cancelled or moved online. Reflect on how you spent your non-academic time during the last year. In what ways was your community engagement different than you had expected? Did you develop any new skills or qualities as a result of these changes? (250 words or less)

While I'm not sure about next year, for this section I wrote it anecdotally. I described how the emotions/feelings I felt drove me to pursue different activities, and what COVID's free time allowed me to.

## Personal Profile (AKA the Interview)

The Personal Profile is a 3-question online interview process. It is NOT person to person, rather, your answers are recorded in both video and written format.
The questions are pre-recorded, and randomly taken from a large question bank.

Unfortunately, I am barred from sharing my own questions with anyone else. However, I will give general advice for each question based on trends of previous years.
I've also included questions I've found online on subreddits, forums, and preparation websites.

**Question 1**: You will have 10 minutes to prepare and type a 250-word written response.
* The written one often asks you to recount experiences where you showed character, or defend an opinion given a scenario.
    * For example: Tell us about an experience that helped you become a leader/team player.


**Question 2**: You will record a two-minute video response.
* This shorter video response often asks you about yourself, and why you're interested in engineering/UofT.
    * For example: What is an experience that made you interested in engineering?

**Question 3**: You will record a three-minute video response.
* The last question is often a problem solving question. You are given a scenario/problem, and asked what 3 pieces of information/variables you would need to implement a solution.
  Some questions might involve a bit of Fermi math.
    * For example: What 3 most important things do you need to know to best determine a city's number of gas stations?

### Interview Tips

These tips are completely of my own opinion and experiences:

**Take advantage of your time between questions**

* In between each question you will have a few minutes to prepare the response. Please take the time between these questions to gather your breath, calm down, even meditate.
* Just because you did poorly on a question does NOT mean you failed. Relax, refocus, and do your best on the next question. What's done is done, you can't change anything about it.

**Prepare, practice, get comfortable on camera**

* Aside from the examples I gave you, dig around on the web for questions people received years ago. Collect these into a Google Doc, and take a night or two to go through them.
* Ask yourself/get a friend to ask you these questions. Do mock interviews. Practice what you'd say - prepare a list of experiences that might help you answer questions about teamwork, leadership, etc.
* GET COMFORTABLE ON CAMERA (underrated advice). Being on camera and seeing yourself speak is nerve-wracking. You'll think things like "jeez that's how my mouth looks when I speak??" To prevent these anxious thoughts, get comfortable beforehand!

**READ THE QUESTION**

* For my problem solving question, I didn't fully read the question. I missed an entire part of it, with only like 30 seconds left on my preparation timer.
* Consequently, I panicked, and in my opinion gave one of the worst answers possible for that question.

**In case you don't understand something...**

* The problem solving question's wording might be confusing. In the case that it is, try your best to interpret it, and solve it based off that.
* Present your interpretation briefly when recording your response. This will give the admissions officer a better understanding of where you're coming from.

**Don't BS. Keep it short if you can**

* Just because you're given 2 minutes does not mean you should fill those 2 minutes. Keep it straight to the point, don't go on tangents.
* If you're curious about my time allotment: I took 1 minute / 2 minutes for the first video response, and 1 min 15 seconds / 3 minutes for the second one.

**Take notes on your computer**

* Notetaking by hand is not a requirement (idk why so many ppl recommend it)
* Typing is faster than writing (usually)
* You can face the camera (assuming laptop/monitor webcam) while speaking

**Other basic stuff**

I'm not going to elaborate on these as most of them are self-explanatory:
* Look presentable (but don't go all out suit/tux, I did mine in a hoodie)
* Be somewhere quiet and not distracting

# Timeline

Like many other things, a bit of magic and effort in grade 12 likely won't get you into U of T Engineering. This is a multi-year process.

### Grade 9 & 10
The marks you get during these years **won't be seen by Ontario universities/colleges.**
Your goals should be smoothly transitioning into high school, establishing work habits, exploring different clubs and activities that interest you.
By exploring different opportunities, you can begin narrowing down to things you really enjoy in grade 11 and 12 (the things you'll eventually write a lot about in your applications).

### Grade 11
Try fast-tracking some grade 12 courses. Personally, I fast-tracked Advanced Functions (MHF4U) and Chemistry (SCH4U).
This really helped me free up my grade 12 year, and allowed me to more easily juggle these supplementary applications and schoolwork.

Narrow down your commitments list - when it comes to extra-curriculars, quality > quantity.

Begin thinking about what you want to do after high school. Despite this being a post about U of T Engineering, I REALLY want to stress that **UNIVERSITY IS NOT MANDATORY**.
College, apprenticeships, or going directly into the workforce are all noble pursuits. We need to stop pretending that university is the next place where everyone should go.

### Grade 12

#### Focus on your grades.

I know people say "grades aren't everything." But sadly, the fact of the matter is that grades are one of the strongest indicators to an admissions officer about you.
Your Top 6 average for ANY Engineering program at University of Toronto are composed of: 

* Advanced Functions (MHF4U)
* Calculus and Vectors (MCV4U)
* English (ENG4U)
* Physics (SPH4U)
* Chemistry (SCH4U)
* another the highest non-prerequisite U or M level course of your choice

The `Mean OSS average` is the mean average of Ontario Secondary Students in each program. Anything around it would be a competitive average.

#### Should I take AP courses?

To my knowledge, the Faculty of Applied Science and Engineering does not take AP scores as credits. However, there is a section on the supplementary application to send your test scores through the College Board.

I think AP courses can better prepare you for what you'll learn in your first year at university. It also shows the admissions officers you've taken on a challenge in high school. Aside from this though, I don't think
it has much merit. If you're looking for easier grades, taking non-AP courses might be the way for you.

#### Month by month...

**September - November**

Do your research into programs that interest you. Attend the OUF (Ontario Universities Fair), open houses, webinars, visit campuses if you can, and dig around university websites.
Join University Discords, follow these accounts on Instagram, reach out on LinkedIn.

**November - January**

After receiving your OUAC codes in November, begin working on your supplementary applications. Usually, the U of T engineering supplementary application is due EARLY Feb. It was Feb 1 this year.
February might seem long away... but start early. Please start early. START FU**ING EARLY. Don't be like me and procrastinate.

U of T Engineering's early decision deadline was December 15 this year. It will likely be mid December next year too. If you're looking to make this deadline, GRIND GRIND GRIND the supplementary application.
The worst thing you can do is drag this on during exam season in January, or even save it until the last day.

**February - March**

U of T slowly releases their first rounds of offers in February and March. Don't worry if you don't get an offer then, usually a smaller number of offers are sent out compared to the later, final round.

**April - May**

Your midterm grades from 2nd semester would now be sent to the universities.
A final decision is made in May: offer, alternate offer, or no offer.
You'll also get any scholarship updates too, if you haven't already been contacted.

**June**

If you've received an offer, congratulations! :D
Make sure to make a decision on what program you'll attend before the given deadline (usually June 1st).

# Concluding remarks

The application process will seem daunting. But if you start early and heed some of this advice, you will be absolutely fine.
My engineering teacher had a nice saying:

"How do you eat an elephant? Piece by piece."

Chip the work into bits, and do little at a time. I promise that by the end of this all, you'll be OK!

For those who fear rejection: don't let a university rejection define your potential as a person. Instead, view it as a message that the program wasn't a good fit for you.
Admissions officers usually have a good understanding of the types of students that will do well and be happy in their program. Don't try to fit this "mold" of a person,
when you might not be! You likely won't be happy there down the road, and be uber stressed from the workload.

Remember, life is a journey, not a destination.
