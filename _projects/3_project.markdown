Competitive programming has been a side hobby since I began learning how to code. 

I started out on [WCIPEG](https://wcipeg.com/user/thejammer), but quickly transitioned over to the [DMOJ](https://dmoj.ca/user/the_jammerr) and 
[WLMOJ](https://mcpt.ca/user/thejammer) judges. 
I also frequently compete in my school's Lyon's Computing Contest, as a member of our school's programming team.


My main [repository](https://github.com/thejammerr/Competitive-Programming) includes solutions to problems from:
CCC/CCO, DMOPC, ECOO, GlobeX Cup, LCC, and USACO.
