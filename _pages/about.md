Hey, I'm Jae!

I'm a first year [Engineering Science](https://engsci.utoronto.ca/program/what-is-engsci/){:target="_blank"} student at the University of Toronto. 

I'm currently working a research assistant at Sunnybrook's [Focused Ultrasound (FUS) Lab](https://sunnybrook.ca/research/content/?page=sri-groups-fus){:target="_blank"} 
under the supervision of Dr. Ryan Jones. My work's focus is on novel phase-correction methods for high-frequency FUS transducers and medical image processing. Working in a research hospital has cultivated my passion about using technology to improve people's lives.

Explore this website for a better idea of who I am and what I can do. 
I'm always open to new opportunities, so feel free to contact me!
