*Hey!*

I'm an incoming [Engineering Science](https://engsci.utoronto.ca/program/what-is-engsci/){:target="_blank"} student at the University of Toronto. Call me Jae.

I love helping others, making useful technology, and doing meaningful work.

I'm currently working full-time as a summer research intern for Sunnybrook's Focused Ultrasound Lab under the supervision of Dr. Ryan Jones. 
Explore my resume, blog, and past projects for a better idea of who I am and what I can do. I'm always looking for new opportunities, so feel free to contact me!
