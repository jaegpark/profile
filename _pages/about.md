*Hey, I'm Jae!*

I'm a first year [Engineering Science](https://engsci.utoronto.ca/program/what-is-engsci/){:target="_blank"} student at the University of Toronto. I'm currently working part-time as a research assistant at Sunnybrook's [Focused Ultrasound (FUS) Lab](https://sunnybrook.ca/research/content/?page=sri-groups-fus){:target="_blank"} under the supervision of Dr. Ryan Jones. My work's focus is to improve pre-clinical FUS treatments. 

I'm passionate about using technology to improve people's lives. Explore my resume, blog, and past projects for a better idea of who I am and what I can do. I'm always looking for new opportunities, so feel free to contact me!
