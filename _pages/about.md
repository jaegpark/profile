*Hiya!*

I'm a grade 12 MaCS/AP student at William Lyon Mackenzie CI. Call me Jae.

I love helping others, making useful technology, and doing meaningful work.

I'm currently learning chess, taking [MIT OCW's 18.06sc Linear Algebra](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06sc-linear-algebra-fall-2011/), and thinking about starting a college VLOG YouTube Channel. 

Explore my blog and projects for a better idea of who I am and what I do. I'm always looking for new opportunities, so feel free to contact me!
