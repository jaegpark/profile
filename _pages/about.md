*Hey!*

I'm an incoming [Engineering Science](https://engsci.utoronto.ca/program/what-is-engsci/){:target="_blank"} student at the University of Toronto. Call me Jae.

I love helping others, making useful technology, and doing meaningful work.

I'm currently taking MIT's [Linear Algebra](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06sc-linear-algebra-fall-2011/){:target="_blank"} and [Multivariable Calculus](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-02sc-multivariable-calculus-fall-2010/index.htm){:target="_blank"},
 and thinking about starting a college VLOG YouTube Channel. 

Explore my blog and projects for a better idea of who I am and what I can do. I'm always looking for new opportunities, so feel free to contact me!
